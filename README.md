# Written Report

## Introduction
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines have become indispensable in modern software development practices. They offer a streamlined approach to software delivery, allowing teams to integrate code changes frequently and automatically deploy them to production environments. The significance of CI/CD pipelines lies in their ability to enhance collaboration among developers, improve code quality, and accelerate the delivery process. By automating the build, test, and deployment stages, CI/CD pipelines reduce the risk of errors and inconsistencies, ensuring that software updates are released reliably and efficiently. Furthermore, CI/CD pipelines enable teams to be more agile than ever before, iterate quickly on features, and respond promptly when necessary. In a world where innovation and time-to-market are crucial, CI/CD pipelines empower organizations to deliver high-quality software rapidly, thereby gaining a competitive edge in the market.

## DevContainer Environment


## Source Code Version Control Tools
For my project, I've opted for Git as my version control system due to its widespread adoption, robust branching and merging capabilities, and seamless integration with various hosting platforms. Git's distributed nature allows for a flexible workflow, while its performance ensures efficient operations. Overall, Git provides the ideal solution for managing our project's source code and facilitating the possibility for effective collaboration in the future.
